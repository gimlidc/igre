# IGRE project

IGRE means Information Gain with REgistration. It is a scientific project originally focused on ART, but with many 
overlaps to different areas with multimodal datasets

# Smart CLI

Igre contains several tools which can be useful for data manipulation or quick overview

- PSD layer exporter
- Images to hypercube aggregation (*.npy supported)
- Information gain calculator
- 3D matrix cropping tool (*.mat and *.npy format supported)
